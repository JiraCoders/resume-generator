# AI Resume Generator (Chrome Extension)

## Instructions

1. Run `server_build.sh` to build the server. If you have already run `server_build.sh` before, then you can start the server by running `server.run.sh`
2. Refer DOCX template example in `backend/examples/template.docx` and create your own Word format resume templates in the `backend/templates` directory.
3. Download the latest version on [GitHub Release](https://github.com/azurespheredev/resume-generator/releases)
4. Go to `chrome://extensions`, and click the `Load Unpacked` button on the top left corner, and load the extracted Chrome extension folder (from zip to directory).
5. Open the installed extension as a sidebar, click the settings button, and update the configurations.

â€» If you'd like your shortcut preference, go to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` and find settings for **SwiftCV** / **Generate tailored resume from selected text**, and change the shortcut key.
